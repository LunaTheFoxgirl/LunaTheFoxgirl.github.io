   I am the lead developer of Inochi2D and have an intimate understanding of its structure and tools and can adapt it to the needs of your game production pipeline.
   With Inochi2D I maintain [Inochi Creator](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-creator) and [Inochi Session](https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-session), which uses ImGui for UI rendering.  
   [Inochi2D Unity](https://github.com/Inochi2D/com.inochi2d.inochi2d-unity) is a Unity port and integration of Inochi2D which I am working on.

 * Game Engines & Tooling  
   I have a relatively big portfolio of [custom made game engines](https://github.com/LunaTheFoxgirl/vtjam-engine) on my personal GitHub account, I additionally have contributed to engines such as [ZyeWare](https://github.com/zyebytevt/zyeware).  
   I also contribute and maintain various game development related libraries, such as [inmath](https://code.dlang.org/packages/inmath) and [audio-formats](https://code.dlang.org/packages/audio-formats).

 * [DKOS](https://github.com/LunaTheFoxgirl/dkos)  
   DKOS is a SDK for the SEGA Dreamcast using D, binding to the open source KallistOS.  
   DKOS allows you to develop games for the SEGA Dreamcast that can run on real hardware using CD-ROMs.

 * Game Jams  
   I have participated in various game jams, such as [Ludum Dare 39 (Unity)](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/rootemergency), [Linux Game Jam 2018 (Custom Engine)](https://itch.io/jam/linux-game-jam-2018/rate/245195), [VTuber Game Jam 1 (Custom Engine)](https://lunafoxgirlvt.itch.io/danmaku-1) and [VTuber Game Jam 2 (Custom Engine)](https://nethyr-ai.itch.io/behind-masked-hearts)

 * [Dead Pets Unleashed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851720/Dead_Pets_Unleashed/) (Triple Topping, prior)  
     As an intern I developed tools for analytics and gameplay for Dead Pets Unleashed using C# and Unity.  
     I also developed some smaller gameplay components and have experience with Wwise and Unity's audio engine.
   * I additionally have helped with providing input on getting Triple Topping's other games running smoothly on Linux/Steam Deck.
